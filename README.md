# Cursive cyrillic handwritten text recognition project

Unpack following files into project folder: 
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J66qpSdfstA3Us5WpnxbcyAP3AekzAvb/view?usp=sharing


To run the main part of project use Jupiter NoteBook on files:
- Experiment SVM and KNN classification.ipynb
- Experiment CNN classification.ipynb

PS: Due to the lack of training data, no positive results are obtained :(

Problems unsolved:
- Good enough character segmentation (which is complex problem on its own accord)
- Maintenance of order of detected words when not written in one column
- Creation of BIG data set along with ligatures, almost no recognition is received either from SVM, KNN or CNN approaches
